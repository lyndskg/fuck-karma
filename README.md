# fxck-karma

fxck-karma is basically my answer to a question that plagues me daily (if not multiple times a day): "Can I afford this?"

It is a coding project that aims to help users make informed financial decisions by determining if they can afford a particular item or expense. The tool will consider the user's income, expenses, and financial goals to assess whether they have sufficient funds to make a purchase or take on a financial commitment. fxck-karma will provide valuable insights to prevent impulsive spending and promote responsible financial planning.

## Key Features:
1. User Input: Users will provide details about their income, recurring expenses, and any specific financial goals or savings targets.
2. Affordability Assessment: The program will analyze the user's financial data to determine if they can afford a particular expense or purchase.
3. Real-Time Updates: Users can modify their financial inputs to see how different scenarios impact their affordability.
4. Financial Recommendations: fxck-karma will offer personalized recommendations on managing finances, saving for future expenses, or avoiding overspending.
5. Visualization: The tool may present financial data in graphical form to help users better understand their financial situation.
6. Security and Privacy: The project will prioritize data security and privacy, ensuring that sensitive financial information is protected.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python or JavaScript are suitable coding languages for this project. Both languages offer easy-to-use libraries for financial calculations and user interface development.

## Basic Workflow:
1. User Input: Users will input their monthly income, expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.), and any financial goals (e.g., savings targets) into the tool.
2. Affordability Calculation: The program will analyze the user's financial data to calculate their available disposable income and assess if they can afford a specific purchase or financial commitment.
3. Real-Time Updates: Users can modify their financial inputs to see how it affects their affordability status, allowing them to experiment with different financial scenarios.
4. Recommendations: Based on the affordability assessment,fxck-karma will provide recommendations to users on how to reach their financial goals and make informed spending decisions.
5. Visualization: The tool may use graphs or charts to visualize the user's financial data, providing a clearer understanding of their financial situation.
6. Security and Privacy: The project will implement security measures to protect users' financial information and ensure data privacy.


## Basic I/O Details:
fxck-karma can be implemented as a web or mobile application with a user-friendly interface.


1. User Input: Users will input their income, expenses, and financial goals into the application through a form-like interface.
2. Output: The tool will display the affordability status, indicating whether the user can afford a specific item or financial commitment. It will also offer financial recommendations and potentially show visualizations of the user's financial data.


fxck-karma will not store users' personal financial information after the calculation and will prioritize data privacy and security.
